# New Age Marketing

## Description

Wanted to build a website that was accessible for everyone, when I say everyone that especially means people with disabilities. I noticed throughout the web that it wasnt that many websites that were accessible for people with disabilities so I made it my mission that any website I build would fit into the accessibility standards. I learn that by making sure my website fits into the accessibility standards it will also be optimized for search engines.
