# New Age Marketing

## Description

Wanted to build a website that was accessible for everyone, when I say everyone that especially means people with disabilities. I noticed throughout the web that it wasnt that many websites that were accessible for people with disabilities so I made it my mission that any website I build would fit into the accessibility standards. I learn that by making sure my website fits into the accessibility standards it will also be optimized for search engines.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
